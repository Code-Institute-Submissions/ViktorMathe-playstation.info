            <h2>PlayStation 5:</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
                Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the <span>PS5 was released on November 12,
                    2020</span>, in
                Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following a week
                later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's Xbox
                Series X and Series S consoles, which were released in the same month.

                The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital
                Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games
                through digital download. The two variants were launched simultaneously.

                The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data
                streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of <span>4K
                    resolution
                    display at up to 120 frames per second</span>, hardware-accelerated <span>ray tracing for realistic
                    lighting and
                    reflections</span>, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other
                features
                include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with the majority of
                PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.</p>
            <p>There is a gameplay on the right to have a look at the time how the games looked like on PlayStation 5
                console</p>
