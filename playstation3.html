            <h2>PlayStation 3:</h2>
            <p>PlayStation 3 is Sony's third video game console. It was <span>released</span> in Japan on <span>November
                    11, 2006</span>. It came
                out on November 17, 2006 in North America, and was released in Australia and Europe on 23 March 2007[5].
                It is competing against the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii consoles. Sony's previous consoles were
                the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation (PSOne).[6]

                The console is sold in<span> two models</span>. One costs $399 and has a 40 gigabyte hard drive. This
                model cannot
                play PlayStation 2 games for cost reasons, but PS1 is still supported. The other costs $499 and has an
                80 gigabyte hard drive.
                The PS3 is, according to Sony, the most powerful seventh generation console. However, many people that
                create computer games have recently stated that both the PS3 and Xbox 360 are about equal. It is more
                expensive than the Xbox 360 or Wii. An upside is that to access the online mode to play and interact
                with other people is free unlike the Xbox in which must be paid for.

                <span>It is the only seventh generation console that can Play Blu-ray discs.</span>

                In July 2007, Sony announced that they would cut the price of the PS3 in the United States.[8] Sony also
                replaced the 60 gigabyte version with an 80 gigabyte version.</p>
            <p>There is a gameplay to have a look at the time how the games looked like on PlayStation 3
                console</p>
